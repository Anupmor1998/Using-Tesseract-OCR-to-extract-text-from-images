# Using-Tesseract-OCR-to-extract-text-from-images
esseract works best when there is a (very) clean segmentation of the foreground text from the background. In practice, it can be extremely challenging to guarantee these types of segmentations. Hence, we tend to train domain-specific image classifiers and detectors.  Nevertheless, itâ€™s important that we understand how to access Tesseract OCR via the Python programming language in the case that we need to apply OCR to our own projects (provided we can obtain the nice, clean segmentations required by Tesseract).
